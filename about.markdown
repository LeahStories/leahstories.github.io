I have always have the dream in the back of my head of becoming a writer.

As unlikely as this may seem, it is still one of my dearest dream.

I love to write dark short stories about suicide or rape for example.

If anything in my stories are close to something you experienced, please take care of yourself and talk to someone about it <3

I decided to share some of the stories that I have written to know what people who do not already know me truly think of them.

I am in my twenties and still a student in literature.

I might also share some stories in French.

I also am currently writing my first novel, which I'm very excited about!

I have an Instagram account where you can find some shorter texts such as poems or thoughts that I have written in one go some time more or less long ago.

There is no chronology in the stories I intend to share, as in, I will not necessarily share the latest ones I have written, but rather will share the ones I see fit at specific times. So they might have been written earlier than the previous ones posted.

That is all for me now :)

I hope you enjoy! <3
